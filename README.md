# Attendance calculator
A comprehensive attendance calculator that helped me plan my days off.

The backend of this code was designed using PHP/cURL. The backend fetched the data from the student portal and displayed it as a table. Unfortunately, I cannot upload the backend code of this project as it needs to be connected to the intranet to work. It just seems pointless trying to use it from anywhere else, really. This PHP script accepted the username and password from the user and passed it on to the student portal endpoint (which soon had a captcha <s>that was easy to bypass</s>). I used an <a href='http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net'>HTML parsing library</a> to extract attendance information and display it as a table.

I used JavaScript/jQuery to dynamically generate tables and the compute the attendance. CSS to make it look good. Twitter Bootstrap too, obviously.

This page is just a static dump of what was generated by the PHP script (I saved the webpage). Most of the JavaScript functions still work, but some are obsolete.
